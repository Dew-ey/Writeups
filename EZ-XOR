I begin with downloading the package from the link. After it is downloaded I do a file command just to see exactly what i'm working with.



Seeing that it is just inputting data I decide to do a binwalk on it to see if it contains any hidden directories. 

Upon completing a binwalk I am able to see that this is most likely a zlib directory with several PNGâ€™s stored within it.

So I decide that the best course of action is to change it to a zlib file:

Now after searching to find the file extension to name it I came across this website https://filext.com/file-extension/ZLIB which is an online source for opening zlib files 

The website lets me extract all strings to a simple .txt file, looking through it with a grep I find nothing, so I go back to manually looking through the library. 

Passing through the screenshots folder the file Capture(1).png contains a photo of L from the anime Death Note with the flag right below
